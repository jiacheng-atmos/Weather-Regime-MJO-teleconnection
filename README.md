This repo provides detailed process of calculating weather regime. The weather regimes can be regarded as an important source of 
S2S predictability. It can also be viewed as local attractor of which phase space is smaller than the whole space. 

I should mention that there are numerous articles debating the existence of weather regime. However, by using the concept of weather
regime, the S2S prediction has been improved significantly. Here, I applied the most popular definition, which is called EOF-Kmeans method.

# Attentions:  
 From my superficial understandings, none of these definitions are achieved purely from physcial thinking. I personally do not fully support the 
 EOF-Kmeans and geopotential height contour method because we are using the our assumed conclusion to get our desired result... 
 (Like from engineer's world view. No offense, I'm also an engineer, or a less qualified engineer:))

There are a lot of work awaiting to be completed...
