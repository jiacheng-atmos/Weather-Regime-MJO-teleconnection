# Weather Regime-MJO-teleconnection

This repository includes the scripts for weather regime calculation. Weather regimes can be regarded as an important source of S2S predictability. They can be viewed as local attractors whose phase space is smaller than the whole system's space (e.g., Kimoto and Ghil 1993).

There are many articles debating the existence of weather regimes. However, by using the concept of weather regime, the S2S prediction has been improved significantly. Here, the weather regimes are derived through K-means clustering method applied on EOF reconstructed 500 hPa field. 

# Attention on weather regime calculation:
I focus on North American weather regimes. 
Part 1: Achieve weather regime.
Part 2: Calculate the anomalous percentage of weather regime lagged by different MJO lead days. 
Our work can help to diagnose the teleconnection induced by MJO. The RMM is less meaningful if the model is not representing tropical-extratropical interaction
in the right way.
