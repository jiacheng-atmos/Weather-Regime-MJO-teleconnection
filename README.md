# Weather Regime-MJO-teleconnection (For related references, feel free to reach me to get it)

This repo provides detailed process of calculating weather regime. The weather regimes can be regarded as an important source of 
S2S predictability. It can also be viewed as local attractor of which phase space is smaller than the whole space. 

We would appreciate it a lot if you agree to cite our paper if you decide to borrowe some code here :)

I should mention that there are numerous articles debating the existence of weather regime. However, by using the concept of weather
regime, the S2S prediction has been improved significantly. Here, I applied the most popular definition, which is called EOF-Kmeans method.

# Attention on weather regime definition:  
 From my superficial understandings, none of these definitions are achieved purely from physcial thinking. I personally do not fully support the 
 EOF-Kmeans and geopotential height contour method because we are using preassumed conclusion to get our desired result... It is weird but that's
 how we currently do it.
 
There are a lot of work awaiting to be completed...

This work is supervised by Zhuo Wang at Illinois (many thanks). 

# Attention on weather regime calculation:
Feel free to reach me if you want sample data. 
We focus on North American weather regimes. 
Part 1: Achieve weather regime.
Part 2: Calculate the anomalous percentage of weather regime lagged by different MJO lead days. 
Our work can help to diagnose the teleconnection induced by MJO. The RMM is meaningless if the model is not representing tropical-extratropical interaction
in the right way.
